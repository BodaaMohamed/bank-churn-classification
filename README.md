# 🚀 Bank Churn Prediction - Binary Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning. The dataset contains customer demographics, account details, and transaction history, with the goal of identifying customers likely to leave.

## 📂 Project Structure
1. **Data Import** 📥  
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊**  
   - Check for missing values and data types.
   - Visualize distributions of numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing 🛠️**  
   - Remove irrelevant columns.
   - Encode categorical variables.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation 🤖**  
   - Split data into training/testing sets.
   - Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:
[Bank Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rangalamahesh/bank-churn)

The dataset consists of customer-related features, including:
- **Customer ID, Name** (Removed for privacy)
- **Age, Gender, Geography**
- **Account balance, Credit score**
- **Estimated salary, Tenure**
- **HasCrCard, IsActiveMember**
- **Exited (Target variable: 1 = Churn, 0 = Retained)**

## 📦 Installation
To set up the environment, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-churn-classification.git
cd bank-churn-classification
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Binary Classification with a Bank Churn.ipynb"
```
3. Run all cells in order.

## 📊 Results
- The best-performing model is selected based on accuracy and evaluation metrics.
- Feature importance analysis provides insights into key churn factors.
- Visualizations help interpret the model's predictions.
